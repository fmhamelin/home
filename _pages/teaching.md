## modelling the COVID-19 epidemic in France

Since 2020, I propose introductory mathematical epidemiology practicals based on the COVID-19 epidemic in France. They are gathered on [this website](https://fmhamelin.github.io/covidagro/) (in French).

## master MODE

Since 2012, I co-head the Master's program in Ecological Modeling ([MODE](https://osur.univ-rennes1.fr/mode/)). MODE is a two-year research-oriented master course for students who are interested in mathematical, statistical and computational ecology and evolution. Classes are in English and French. I am in charge of the following courses:

- Modeling in Ecology and Evolution
- Modeling in Epidemiology

among others.

## modeling plant disease epidemics

At *L'institut Agro*, I teach Quantitative Plant Disease Epidemiology in Plant Health Master's programs.
