  blabla: Israël Tankam C. joined our team in January 2023, specializing in improving potato resistance to cyst nematodes. He is interested in developing, through mathematical models, sustainable strategies for managing the nematodes by combining plant resistance with crop rotation and biocontrol methods. <br><br>With a background in Applied Mathematics, Israël specializes in dynamical systems, mathematical modelling, optimization, and their practical applications in plant epidemiology and crop protection. He received the Ovide Arino Outbreak Award (OAOA) in 2021 for his PhD on sustainable management of banana soil-borne pests. His thesis, "Modelling, analysis, and control of plantain plant-parasitic nematodes," introduces advanced methods for managing soilborne pests through fallows, revealing novel population dynamics and global optimization algorithms. <br><br>During his previous postdoc, Israël modelled the epidemiology of transboundary cassava diseases in Central and West Africa, working with the Epidemiology and Modelling Group at the University of Cambridge and the Central and West Africa Virus Epidemiology for Food Security (WAVE). <br><br>In his free time, Israël enjoys painting, playing music, working out, cooking and reading manga.

  blabla: In 1933, while he was visiting the United States, Adolf Hitler came to power in Germany. Horrified by the Nazi "war of extermination" against his fellow Jews,[12] Einstein decided to remain in the US, and was granted American citizenship in 1940.[13] On the eve of World War II, he endorsed a letter to President Franklin D. Roosevelt alerting him to the potential German nuclear weapons program and recommending that the US begin similar research. Einstein supported the Allies but generally viewed the idea of nuclear weapons with great dismay
