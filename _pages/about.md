I am Associate Professor in Quantitative Plant Disease Epidemiology at [L'Institut Agro](https://www.institut-agro.fr/en) in Rennes, France. I work at the interface between Mathematical Ecology and Plant Disease Epidemiology. I am a member of the Institute of Genetics, Environment and Plant Protection ([IGEPP](https://eng-igepp.rennes.hub.inrae.fr/)).

Short bio: I was first trained as a telecommunications engineer in Brest, Brittany, France. In 2007, I received a PhD in automatic control from the University of Nice, France. During my doctoral thesis and then as a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Alberta, Canada, I explored differential games and their applications to behavioral ecology. Back to Brittany, I joined *L'Institut Agro* in 2008 as a faculty member of the ecology department in Rennes, France. In 2017, I obtained a *Habilitation* in ecology and evolution from U. Rennes. Since 2022, I have been an editor for the journal [Phytopathology](https://apsjournals.apsnet.org/journal/phyto). I am currently leading an ANR funded project named BEEP (Behavioural Epidemiology and Evolution of Plant Pathogens). I am also heading the Plant Heath and Ecology lab of L'Institut Agro in Rennes.
