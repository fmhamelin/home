I am Associate Professor in Quantitative Plant Disease Epidemiology at [L'Institut Agro](https://www.institut-agro.fr/fr) in Rennes, France. I work at the interface between Mathematical Ecology and Plant Disease Epidemiology. I am a member of the [Demecology](https://www6.rennes.inrae.fr/igepp_eng/Research-teams/Demecology) (Dynamics, Evolution, Modelling, Ecology) research group of the Institute of Genetics, Environment and Plant Protection ([IGEPP](https://www6.rennes.inrae.fr/igepp_eng/)).

Short bio: I was first trained as a telecommunications engineer in Brest, Brittany, France. In 2007, I received a PhD in automatic control from the University of Nice, France (supervisors: [Pierre Bernhard](http://www-sop.inria.fr/members/Pierre.Bernhard/index_en.shtml) and [Eric Wajnberg](http://www2.sophia.inra.fr/perso/wajnberg/index.htm)). During my doctoral thesis and then as a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Alberta, Canada (with [Mark A. Lewis](http://grad.biology.ualberta.ca/mlewis/mark-lewis-2/)), I explored differential games and their applications to behavioral ecology. Back to Brittany, France, I joined *L'Institut Agro* in 2008 as a faculty member in the department of ecology in Rennes. In 2017, I obtained a *Habilitation* in ecology and evolution from U. Rennes.
